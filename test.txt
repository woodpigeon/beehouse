; This 'server' definition listens for TCP connections on port <accept> - ie
; a remote connection from the TIE system - and forwards the message
; on to whoever is listening on local port <connect>, which should be Mirth.
; So its interesting to note that while MSE think they are sending ADT
; messages to Mirth on 6661, Mirth is actually listening on 7771.
; The sender has used the public certificate (crt) to encrypt the message so
; we use our private key to unencrypt it. We are essentially terminating a TLS
; connection.
